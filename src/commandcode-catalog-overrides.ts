/**
 * Manual reasoning-effort policy for models the official CLI marks as
 * reasoning-capable without publishing selectable efforts.
 *
 * `src/commandcode-catalog.ts` is generated from the CLI package and must stay
 * byte-identical to upstream so the daily drift check works. Entries here are
 * merged over the generated catalog at load time and are not touched by
 * `npm run sync:commandcode-catalog`.
 *
 * Add a model only when the effort parameter is known to be accepted by the
 * Command Code endpoint; remove it once the CLI catalog ships its own efforts.
 *
 * Currently empty: command-code@1.53.0 publishes selectable efforts for every
 * reasoning model we track, so no manual levels are needed.
