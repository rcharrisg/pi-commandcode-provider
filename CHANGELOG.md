# Changelog

## Unreleased

## 0.7.1 - 2026-09-18

- Normalize nullable type arrays for `google/gemini-*` tools on the generate transport to avoid the gateway's `any_of` validation error, preserving required fields, literal data, and schemas for unrelated models (#99, #103).
- Refresh the Command Code CLI catalog to `1.56.0`, adding image input, reasoning effort levels, a 131,072-token output limit, and reviewed display pricing for `Qwen/Qwen3.8-Omni-Flash` (#102).
- Correct the Oh My Pi update instructions to use `omp plugin install pi-commandcode-provider --force` for npm-installed plugins (#104).

### Contributors

- @JaimeGonzalezVallejo — reported the Gemini nullable-schema failure, contributed the fix and regression tests, and verified it against the live endpoint (#99, #103).
- @Newbie-troll — corrected the Oh My Pi plugin update instructions (#104).

## 0.7.0 - 2026-09-15

- Honor host-resolved image input on the generate transport, including explicit text-only restrictions; fall back to catalog metadata only when host input is absent or empty. Filter unsupported modality strings without unsafe casts.

- Reset the generate transport's idle timeout on every received chunk, allowing active reasoning streams to exceed the timeout overall while still aborting stalled streams (#87).

- Batch consecutive tool-result images after all tool results on the generate transport, preventing interleaved user messages from breaking multi-tool turns with "Tool result is missing".

- Add display pricing for DeepSeek V4.1 Flash, Qwen 3.8 Max 0902, Gemini 3.8 Flash, Muse Spark 1.3 variants, LongCat 2.0 free, and Ling 3.0 Flash Sante free. Verify against the September 15 pricing page and live 69-model catalog; correct DeepSeek V4 Flash and Vision Exp off-peak prices to $0.15/$0.60 with $0.003 cache reads per million tokens.

- Refresh model capabilities to `command-code@1.54.0`: add DeepSeek V4.1 Flash image input and `low`/`high`/`max` efforts, GPT-6 Astra capability metadata, Grok 4.6 image input, and MiniMax M3 efforts. Ling 3.0 Flash Sante is reasoning-capable with a 32K output limit but has no published selectable effort levels. Catalog metadata does not make models absent from the Provider API selectable.
- Replace manual Muse Spark efforts with upstream levels: remove `minimal` for all five models and add `max` for Muse Spark 1.3.
- Rebind a host's preselected built-in Command Code model to the extension's registered transport at session start, preserving configured endpoints and generate fallback on Oh My Pi.
- Make the daily catalog sync self-healing: it now removes manual effort overrides once upstream publishes its own levels and includes that change in the automated pull request.
- Fix the pi end-to-end mock against pi 0.85 and newer by matching Anthropic Messages paths independently of query parameters.

### Contributors

- @pierreraby — repaired catalog synchronization and Pi integration tests (#95).
- @SamYue1 — refreshed model capability metadata (#98).
- @myohei — added and verified model pricing (#93).
- @Star-233 — fixed parallel tool-result image ordering and contributed pricing coverage (#84, #85).
- @leon-zym — fixed stream idle timeout handling (#88).
- @djymike — honored host-resolved input modalities (#94).
- @dangvanthanh, @newCman1, and @eibednejo — contributed overlapping catalog, pricing, reasoning, and image fixes (#86, #91, #92).

### Validation

- Full automated suite and CI, including real Pi and Oh My Pi mock-API integration tests.
- GOAT live E2E passed: reasoning, multi-turn history, runtime commands, abort, tools, vision, and packed artifact.
- Go live E2E remains unverified: the test account returned insufficient credits on its first request. Generate transport mock coverage passes.

## 0.6.4 - 2026-09-03

- Refresh the generated Command Code capability catalog from `command-code@1.40.1` to `command-code@1.44.0`, adding current image-input, reasoning, effort, and output-limit metadata for newly published models.
- Expose selectable thinking levels (`minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`) for `meta/muse-spark-1.3` and `meta/muse-spark-1.3-contributor`, so Pi and Oh My Pi forward the selected `reasoning_effort` instead of keeping thinking disabled.

### Contributors

- @heie54 — added and validated Muse Spark 1.3 reasoning support (#80).

## 0.6.3 - 2026-09-02

- Fix Oh My Pi chat returning `401 Invalid 'Authorization' header` after `/login`: OMP kept the unresolved `$COMMAND_CODE_API_KEY` placeholder as a literal config API key that shadowed its stored credentials and was sent as the Bearer token. The placeholder is now registered only on pi, where it keeps the API-key login method and `--api-key` working next to OAuth; on OMP the provider omits `apiKey` unless a real key is configured. Placeholders passed by the host are also resolved or stripped on the Provider API and compat stream paths, and the legacy generate transport resolves its key through the same rule.
- Cover stored `/login` OAuth and API-key credentials, `--api-key`, and env keys end to end on both pi and Oh My Pi, asserting the exact Bearer token the mock API receives. CI now runs the pi end-to-end suite against a real `pi` binary instead of skipping it.

### Contributors

- @ebreen — reported and diagnosed the Oh My Pi `/login` 401, and opened the fix that this release builds on (#78).

## 0.6.2 - 2026-09-02

- Fix `omp plugin install` on Oh My Pi 18.x, which rejected 0.6.1 because its pi-ai lacks the `registerApiProvider` export; the compat registration now resolves at runtime and is skipped on hosts that register custom APIs themselves.
- Run the Oh My Pi compatibility suite against a real `omp` binary in CI as a required check, and assert there that the extension loads against OMP's bundled pi packages.
- Pin the CI memory benchmark and Oh My Pi jobs to Bun 1.4.0, Node 22.23.2, and pi 0.84.4.

### Contributors

- @AmeMizuki — reported the failing `omp plugin install` on Oh My Pi 18.1.2.

## 0.6.1 - 2026-09-01

- Expose selectable thinking levels (`minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`) for `meta/muse-spark-1.1`, `meta/muse-spark-1.2`, and `meta/muse-spark-1.2-contributor` through a manual catalog override, so `/thinking` and `Shift+Tab` no longer stay locked on `off` for these reasoning models.
- Start from the cached model catalog and refresh it in the background instead of blocking host startup on the catalog request; a first start without a cache still waits for the live catalog.
- Register the `commandcode-custom` API in the `@earendil-works/pi-ai/compat` registry so sibling extensions that stream with the active Command Code model no longer fail with `No API provider registered for api: commandcode-custom` on plain pi.
- Assert structural catalog invariants in the model tests so the daily catalog sync no longer fails on every upstream change.
- Display the monthly renewal date and remaining days in `/commandcode-quota`.
- Stop silently dropping `role: "developer"` messages (for example OMP advisor steering notes, reminders, and nudges). `/alpha/generate` only accepts `user`, `assistant`, and `tool` roles, so developer messages are now forwarded as `user` messages with identical content in the same chronological position instead of disappearing from the request.
- Add `Qwen/Qwen3.8-Flash` and `z-ai/glm-5.3-flash` with their verified reasoning efforts (`low, medium, xhigh` and `low, high, max`) and display pricing.
- Refresh static model capabilities from `command-code@1.40.1`, adding `claude-fable-5-1`, `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash-fast`, and `tencent/hy4-preview` with their reasoning efforts, adding `moonshotai/Kimi-K3` efforts and the `z-ai/glm-5.3-flash` output limit, and dropping the retired `stealth/ox-alpha` and `minimax/minimax-m3-free`.
- Refresh display pricing for the current 62-model catalog, adding `claude-fable-5-1`, `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash-fast`, and `tencent/hy4-preview`, removing the retired `stealth/ox-alpha`, `minimax/minimax-m3-free`, and `minimax/minimax-m2.7-free`, and ending the expired Claude Sonnet 5 introductory and Gemini 3.7 Flash promotional windows.
- Fix `npm run sync:commandcode-catalog` and `npm run check:commandcode-catalog` on Windows by spawning npm through the shell.
- Add a `refresh-model-catalog` agent skill with cross-platform helper scripts that snapshot the live model catalog and regenerate the pricing fixture from `MODEL_COSTS`.

### Contributors

- @warc0s — preserved developer messages on the `/alpha/generate` transport with OMP advisory coverage.
- @jagaliano — added the quota renewal date and diagnosed the failing daily catalog sync.
- @ThomasByr — added GLM 5.3 Flash and Qwen 3.8 Flash and contributed the `refresh-model-catalog` skill.
- @hjshin-ubob — proposed selectable thinking levels for the Muse Spark models.
- @Sokoshy — analyzed the `commandcode-custom` compat registry failure on plain pi.
- @CoderTCY — measured and proposed the cache-first catalog startup.
- @MertSoylu — reported the missing GLM 5.3 Flash effort levels.

## 0.6.0 - 2026-08-25

- Allow switching from a vision-capable model to a text-only model by omitting historical image tool results while preserving their text output; direct image prompts still fail clearly.
- Stream incremental tool-call arguments from the `/alpha/generate` transport instead of waiting for the final complete tool-call event.
- Add a daily GitHub Actions synchronization job that opens or updates a pull request for CLI version, image capability, reasoning, effort, and output-limit changes in the latest published Command Code catalog.
- Refresh static model capabilities from `command-code@1.32.2`, separating reasoning support from selectable effort levels and honoring model-specific output limits.
- Reject truncated, aborted, and network-failed generate streams instead of reporting partial responses as successful.
- Normalize malformed tool results and synthesize missing tool results so follow-up requests preserve valid tool-call history.
- Refresh display pricing for all 58 current models, including Gemini 3.7 Flash, Qwen 3.8 27B, Ox Alpha, Muse Spark 1.2, and Grok 4.6 long-context rates.
- Accept the official `COMMAND_CODE_API_KEY` and `CMD_ZDR` environment variables while retaining legacy aliases.
- Align generate request metadata with the CLI by forwarding stable session IDs, optional temperature, and the CLI user agent.
- Validate manually pasted API keys, use the CLI's two-minute browser timeout, and reject OAuth state mismatches without closing the callback server.
- Add `/commandcode-quota` with live credits, plan, usage totals, and rolling-limit diagnostics from Command Code's alpha usage endpoints.
- Add `zai-org/GLM-5.3` with its verified reasoning efforts and display pricing.
- Prefer Command Code's Provider API (`/provider/v1/chat/completions` and `/provider/v1/messages`) and automatically fall back to the existing `/alpha/generate` transport only when the Provider API returns `403 upgrade_required` for a Go-plan account.
- Remember the detected transport for the running process, re-detect it when credentials change, prevent stale in-flight requests from overwriting the new credential's transport, and never fall back for unrelated authentication, permission, rate-limit, network, or server failures.
- Use Pi's native OpenAI- and Anthropic-compatible providers for Provider API streaming, including adaptive thinking for current reasoning-capable Claude models, while preserving the existing hardened generate transport, dynamic model discovery, offline cache, refresh/status commands, pricing, and OAuth credentials.
- Let `/login` use browser authentication, an explicit API-key prompt, or a directly pasted API key.
- Add optional zero-data-retention headers through `CMD_ZDR=1` and the legacy `COMMANDCODE_ZDR=1` alias.
- Refresh GPT-5.6 Terra and Luna display prices after their temporary 50% promotion ended, and display the current DeepSeek V4 off-peak rates for its time-dependent pricing.
- Add isolated live E2E profiles for separate Go-, GOAT-, and Provider-plan credentials, covering transport selection, reasoning across turns, quota identity, aborts, tools, GOAT vision, Go image rejection, and packed-package validation.
- Fix extension load failure on newer pi hosts that reject registering a custom API under a built-in name (`openai-completions`); register under `commandcode-custom` instead and restore the real wire API before native compat dispatch.

### Contributors

- @jagaliano — added the live quota dashboard and hardened its integration.
- @omariqbalnaru — fixed custom API registration for Oh My Pi 17.4.0.
- @ThomasByr — added GLM-5.3 pricing and reasoning levels.
- @newCman1 — added DeepSeek V4 vision model support.

## 0.5.1 - 2026-08-11

- Add model-specific image input capabilities from the `command-code@1.15.1` catalog and forward user and tool-result images using the current Command Code wire format.
- Update the Command Code client version header to `1.15.1`.

### Contributors

- @DiyarD — reported missing vision support for GPT-5.6 Luna, Muse Spark 1.2, and other vision-capable models.

## 0.5.0 - 2026-08-07

- Stop replaying completed assistant reasoning traces to Command Code while preserving visible text and completed tool calls in follow-up request history.
- Add `/commandcode-refresh` and `/commandcode-status` commands for safe model-catalog refreshes and redacted diagnostics.
- Bound model discovery to a configurable 10-second timeout so a slow Provider API cannot block pi startup; timed-out discovery uses the validated cache when available.
- Normalize Command Code context overflow failures so pi can auto-compact and retry, while leaving unrelated rate-limit and capacity errors unchanged.
- Keep the legacy `/alpha/generate` integration explicitly text-only: image input and image tool results are rejected instead of being silently dropped, and models do not claim image capability until the protocol exposes documented support and limits.
- Replace blanket reasoning metadata with model-specific Command Code effort support. Known models expose a `thinkingLevelMap`, and selected supported Pi levels are forwarded as `params.reasoning_effort`; unsupported or unknown models do not receive reasoning request fields.
- Add repository commands for testing the current checkout either in a logged-out, automatically cleaned-up pi environment or with existing credentials and only Command Code models enabled.
- Refresh display pricing for the current Command Code model catalog, remove expired Qwen promotional rates, add current free and discounted models, and require review when temporary prices expire.
- Use the host-provided `pi-ai` and `pi-coding-agent` core packages instead of installing private runtime copies, including for local and out-of-store development checkouts.
- Fix cached input tokens being counted twice.

### Contributors

- @IfkumRfnl — fixed cached input token accounting.

## 0.4.3 - 2026-08-02

- Allow pi to start when model discovery is unavailable. The provider now caches the last successfully fetched model catalog so previously discovered Command Code models remain selectable offline; a first offline start without a cache keeps Command Code unavailable until `/reload` succeeds.

### Contributors

- @k3-2o — reported that the model-list fetch blocked pi startup when offline.

## 0.4.2 - 2026-07-05

- Fix Oh My Pi extension validation by avoiding the missing `calculateCost` export from OMP's legacy `pi-ai` shim.
- Add a regression test that locks the local Command Code cost calculation to pi-ai's upstream `calculateCost` behavior.

### Contributors

- @CoderTCY — reported the Oh My Pi installation failure.

## 0.4.1 - 2026-06-16

- Use the explicit `$COMMANDCODE_API_KEY` provider registration syntax expected by newer pi versions, removing the startup deprecation warning while keeping legacy placeholder compatibility.
- Refresh development dependency lockfile entries to resolve npm audit findings for `tsx`/`esbuild` and `protobufjs`.

### Contributors

- @plumj-am — fixed the pi provider `apiKey` deprecation warning.
- @cad0p — reported retry/deprecation-related issues that helped validate the current behavior.
- @bl4zee1g — reported provider availability concerns that prompted additional local/live validation.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-06-02

- Add retry mechanism for transient HTTP errors (429, 5xx) and stream-level errors, configurable via pi `settings.json` `retry.provider` fields (`timeoutMs`, `maxRetries`, `maxRetryDelayMs`). Supports exponential backoff with jitter and `Retry-After` header.

## 0.3.1 - 2026-05-29

- Bump CLI version header to `0.29.0` for Command Code API parity.
- Harden PR security pipeline CI configuration.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-05-28

- Add OMP (Oh My Pi) provider compatibility: support `~/.omp/agent/auth.json` auth path, handle OMP's env-var-name-as-apiKey quirk, convert OMP system prompt arrays to text.
- Close open thinking blocks before starting text or tool output to prevent event ordering issues when upstream omits `reasoning-end`.
- Correct DeepSeek V4 Pro discount as permanent (no expiry), not time-limited.
- Correct DeepSeek V4 Flash cache-read rate to $0.028/M and add xiaomi/mimo models to pricing table.
- Upgrade pi dependencies from `@mariozechner` 0.72.0 to `@earendil-works` 0.75.5.
- Move `pi-coding-agent` to optional peerDependencies.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-05-27

- Stream `reasoning-delta` events incrementally instead of buffering the full thinking block until `reasoning-end`. Emits `thinking_start`, `thinking_delta`, and `thinking_end` events as they arrive so the UI can show reasoning in real time.
- Close open text blocks on `reasoning-start` and `reasoning-delta` so thinking and text never overlap in the output.
- Add live display pricing (`MODEL_COSTS`) for known Command Code models. Cost falls back to zero for models not yet in the price table until the Provider API exposes pricing directly.
- Fetch models from the Command Code Provider API at startup (inherited from upstream 0.1.1) and overlay the static cost table.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-05-26

- Align Command Code generate requests with CLI `0.27.2` headers and payload shape.
- Support official Command Code CLI auth files using the `command-code` credential key.
- Handle `reasoning-start` and ignore streamed `tool-result` events.
- Cap generated `max_tokens` by the selected model and the Command Code output limit.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-05-05

- Initial public release.
